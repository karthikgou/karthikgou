### Hi there üëã

I'm Karthik Goud Bathula. Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a quick overview of some projects I've been working on:

### üß¨ Machine Learning Development Environment for Single-Cell Sequencing Data Analyses
In the `Machine-learning-development-environment-for-single-cell-sequencing-data-analyses` project, I've made significant strides in combining machine learning with genomics. This project is centered around building a web application to facilitate the analysis and creation of AI-driven benchmark datasets for single-cell sequencing data, showcasing an innovative approach to tackling complex bioinformatics challenges.

**Tech Stack**: ReactJS, Python, FastAPI, R, MongoDB, MySQL, Docker, Uppy Server, Directus CMS, Node JS

**Roles and Responsibilities**:
- **Frontend Development**: Developed a new web application from scratch using ReactJS, focusing on a user-friendly interface and responsive design.
- **Advanced File Management**: Integrated Uppy Server for advanced file uploads from local storage, Google Drive, and Dropbox.
- **Cross-Language Functionality**: Embedded R code within the Python environment using the `rpy2` module for direct execution of R scripts.
- **API Development**: Implemented multiple APIs using Python's FastAPI to operationalize machine learning models written in R and Python.
- **Task Queue Management**: Introduced a Celery Distributed Task Queue to efficiently process multiple concurrent user requests in real-time.
- **Data Management**: Utilized MongoDB and MySQL for robust data management, ensuring secure and scalable storage solutions.
- **Application Containerization**: Containerized the entire application with Docker, adhering to best coding practices for maintainability and scalability.
- **CMS Integration**: Explored and integrated the Directus CMS tool with the web application, separating content management from application logic for enhanced security and ease of updates.

### üåê basicCeleryFunctionality
In the `basicCeleryFunctionality` project, I've explored the power of [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) for distributed task queue management, enabling efficient processing of multiple requests concurrently. This repository showcases my journey through setting up Celery with a simple application, demonstrating its potential in enhancing application scalability and performance.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Celery

**Key Achievements**:
- Implemented Celery with a focus on simplicity and scalability.
- Demonstrated concurrent processing of tasks, significantly improving throughput.
- Explored various Celery configurations and optimizations for real-world applications.
